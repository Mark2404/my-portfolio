        Beyond the defensive potential common to many of the skills in this book, there
        is much the average civilian can learn from an operative’s mindset. First and
        foremost, that mindset is defined by preparedness and awareness. Whether in
        home territory or under deepest cover, operatives are continually scanning the
        general landscape for threats even when they’re not on the clock. Civilians, too,
        can train their minds toward habits such as scouting exit routes in crowded
        restaurants or building spur-of-the-moment escape plans. This kind of vigilance
        allows an operative confronted with sudden danger to take immediate action.
        Whether he is crossing borders, executing surveillance, or eliminating
        dangerous targets and disappearing without a trace, the clandestine operative
        frequently works alone. Given that he so often finds himself behind enemy lines
        without reinforcements, an operative’s combat and counterintelligence skills are
        met by an equally sophisticated aptitude for risk assessment and analysis. In an
        increasingly dangerous world, civilians who are attuned to potential risk
        (particularly but not exclusively when traveling) will be many steps ahead of the
        general populace.

        The operative also demonstrates a baseline predisposition toward anonymity.
        Each clandestine operative is trained to “go black,” operating for extended
        periods of time with limited communication to associates. While operating under
        the radar, he may assume the outward appearance of a student, a businessperson,
        or a traveler, as he understands that terrorist groups or host-nation governments
        may be targeting him during his travels—and that if perceived as a spy and
        arrested, he will be subject to detention and harsh interrogations. Additionally, as
        a traveler, he is vulnerable to the risks of petty crime and kidnapping that apply
        to any civilian traveling abroad. To counter such risks, the operative adopts as
        neutral an appearance as possible. The general rule is the less conspicuous the
        Nomad, the safer.

     <p>When it comes to gear, preparedness doesn’t look quite the way moviegoers
        have come to expect. Because clandestine operatives cannot board commercial
        flights with concealed weapons or high-tech spy gear tucked away in their
        luggage, they favor a “no-tech” or “low-tech” approach that is highly dependent
        on improvisation. Though fictional spies employ all manner of shiny, complex
        contraptions, in the real world, every high-tech toy increases an operative’s risk
        of detention or arrest. Hence, operatives learn to adapt, improvise, and overcome
        technical obstacles using tools and technology that are readily available in the
        country of operation. One example: Every hotel room has a Bible or a Koran
        stashed in a bedside drawer—and taping a couple of those together yields a set
        of improvised body armor that provides significant protection against projectiles.
        Though low-tech doesn’t usually extend to an operative’s communications, he
        takes a highly cautious approach to cybersecurity. The operative avoids leaving
        behind trails of digital breadcrumbs at all costs, understanding that any
        cybercommunication is fundamentally insecure. In an age where savings
        accounts and the locations of friends and family are vulnerable to any third party
        with access to a Wi-Fi connection and the will to do harm, there is no such thing
        as a surfeit of precaution.
        Civilian BLUF: Particularly when traveling, civilians are well served by
        adopting the operative’s predilection for anonymity. Choose clothing and
        accessories for usefulness and general neutrality. In a volatile urban crisis, bright
